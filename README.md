# The Internet Cookbook!

This is a fullstack project that I want to continue to update as I have the time. It features full CRUD capabilities, has image uploading and user authentication. I built the backend out with Node.js and Express.
The ORM I used to connect to the mySQL database was sequelize.

## The home dashboard lets you query the database for recipes without having to log on
